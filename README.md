This project predicts who are the possible Defaulters are for the Consumer Loans Product.
It is a case of binary classification and predicts the outcome of dependent variable "Risk_Flag". It consist of 2 values, i.e. 0 (granting loan is safe) and 1 (granting loan is risky).
Machine learning algorithms used for model building are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN and Gaussian Naive Bayes.
Highest accuracy is achieved by Random Forest of 93%.
The final predictions are saved in the "Final.csv" file.
